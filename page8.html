                   <p>How do civilians train to go into space, you might be wondering? There's some crossover with how astronauts themselves train.</p>

                    <p>Since March, the Inspiration4 crew has completed centrifuge training, simulations, observing other SpaceX launches, zero-gravity plane training, altitude training, classroom training and medical testing, SpaceX says.
                    </p>
                    <p>"This focused preparation was essential in team development and being ready to execute their role as the first commercial crew to orbit the Earth," the Inspiration4 website says.
                    </p>
                    <p>It's also worth mentioning that SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft largely functions on its own and doesn't require much human input to operate.</p>
                    <p>The crew arrived in Florida on Thursday from Hawthorne, Calif., where they had been training.</p>
