                   <p>For the first time, a group of all civilians, four in total, have launched in a SpaceX mission to orbit the planet.</p>

                    <p>The commander of the flight, Jared Isaacman, is the founder and billionaire CEO of Shift4 Payments. He is accompanied by Hayley Arceneaux, a physician assistant at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital; Chris Sembroski, an aerospace data engineer; and pilot and geoscientist Sian Proctor.</p>
                    <p>It's the latest step in the commercialization of space. By going into orbit, the crew of four will travel further into space than the recent privately funded Blue Origin mission that had Amazon founder and billionaire Jeff Bezos on board.</p>
                    <p>It has not been disclosed how much Isaacman paid for him and the crew to get sent into space.</p>
                    <p>The mission, dubbed Inspiration4, will help support Isaacman's goal to raise $200 million to help cure children's cancer. While in orbit, the crew will also conduct research "designed to advance human health on Earth and during future long-duration spaceflights," according to SpaceX.</p>
                    <p>The flight launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The astronauts will land off the coast of Florida after approximately three days.
