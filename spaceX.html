                    <div class="text">
                    <p>Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) is an American aerospace manufacturer, space transportation services and communications corporation</p>

                    <p>SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit (Falcon 1 in 2008), the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft (Dragon in 2010), the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station (Dragon in 2012), the first vertical take-off and vertical propulsive landing for an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2015), the first reuse of an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2017), and the first private company to send astronauts to orbit and to the International Space Station (SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo-2 in 2020). SpaceX has flown and reflown the Falcon 9 series of rockets over one hundred times.</p>

                    <p>SpaceX is developing a satellite megaconstellation named Starlink to provide commercial internet service. In January 2020 the Starlink constellation became the largest satellite constellation ever launched. SpaceX is also developing Starship, a privately funded, fully reusable, super heavy-lift launch system for interplanetary spaceflight. Starship is intended to become the primary SpaceX orbital vehicle once operational, supplanting the existing Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon fleet. Starship is planned to be fully reusable and will have the highest payload capacity of any orbital rocket ever on its debut, scheduled for the early 2020s.</p>

                        <h3>SpaceX’s prototype Mars rocket has flown for the first time</h3>
                        
                        <p>SpaceX’s Starship can fly. The rocket, which is designed to send explorers to the moon and eventually Mars, made its first test flight on 4 August.</p>

                        <p>Like smaller prototypes called Starhoppers that flew in 2019, this test was a quick hop, intended to take the rocket about 150 metres into the air. SpaceX hasn’t yet confirmed whether the hop reached its intended altitude, but overall the flight appeared to be successful, ending with Starship softly landing upright next to the pad from which it launched.</p>

                        </div>  
                       
                        <p>The rocket is about 50 metres tall and 9 metres in diameter and is designed to be fully reusable so that it can land and then launch again shortly afterwards. While its main purpose is to take people and supplies to space, it may someday also be used to travel quickly between locations on Earth.</p>

                        <p>If Starship proves itself in orbit, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said that it will eventually be used to set up colonies on the moon and Mars. The SpaceX website says that Starship, sitting atop a Super Heavy rocket for extra boost, “represent[s] a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, Mars and beyond”.</p>

                        <p>A successful flight test is a major step towards that goal. “Mars is looking real”.</p>
