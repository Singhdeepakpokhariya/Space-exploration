                        crew, which returned after a three-day space
                        mission, was to raise $200 million for St. Jude
                        Children's Research Hospital towards finding
                        cures for kids with cancer and other diseases.
                        Inspiration4's billionaire crew member Jared

                <B> NASA picks Elon Musk's SpaceX to
                    launch GOES-U weather satellite.</B>
                <p>NASA said on Saturday that it has selected
                    billionaire Elon Musk-led SpaceX to provide
                    launch services for its GOES-U mission.
                    The space agency is targeting to launch
                    the mission on Spacex's Falcon Heavy
                    rocket in April 2024. The Geostationary
                    Operational Environmental Satellite-U will
                    provide advanced imagery and atmospheric
                    measurements of Earth's weather, oceans,
                    and environment, NASA said.

                <p>India's first solar mission, Aditya L1, is likely
                    to be launched in the third quarter of 2022
                    which was earlier pushed from early 2020
                    due to COVID-19, Indian Space Research
                    Organisation officials said. India's second
                    space observatory Xposat will also be
                    launched then, they added. The spacecraft in
                    the mission will be sent 1.5 million kilometres
                    away to L1 Lagrangian.

                <B> NASA awards SpaceX, Blue Origin
                    contracts for moon lander concepts.</B>
                <p>NASA has selected five US companies,
                    including SpaceX and Blue Origin to develop
                    lander concepts as part of the agency's
                    Artemis program. SpaceX has been awarded
                    $9.4 million, while Blue Origin received
                    
                    $25.6 million. All the five firms will develop
                    the concepts, evaluating their performance,
                    mission assurance requirements, interfaces,
                    safety, crew health accommodations, and
                    medical capabilities.

                <p>China has developed a prototype miniature
                    helicopter for future Mars missions. The
                    prototype of 'Mars cruise drone’ passed a
                    final acceptance review on August 20, the
                    National Space Science Center (NSSC) under
                    the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)
                    announced. As per the image released,
                    
                    the prototype sports two rotor blades, a
